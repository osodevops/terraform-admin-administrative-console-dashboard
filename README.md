Converted the CloudFormation on the aws guide for [Building an administrative console in Amazon QuickSight to analyze usage metrics](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/building-an-administrative-console-in-amazon-quicksight-to-analyze-usage-metrics/)
into terraform. To enable the creation of the resources in any region more easily. 

See `examples/complete` for a working example, this module creates the resources needed to create the QuickSight dashboard and the resources stated in the CloudFormation 
such as Lambda, CloudWatch event, s3 bucket etc.

---






## Usage

Terraform 1.2.6 
A state resource such as an s3 bucket or terraform cloud.




## Examples

  module "quick_sight_dashboard" {
    source     = "../.."
  }
```
